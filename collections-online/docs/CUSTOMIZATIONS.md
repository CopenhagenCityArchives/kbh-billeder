# Customizations

A folder to keep your configurations and potential customizations of the
collections-online templates, scripts and styling.

It's a good idea to check the files of this folder into some sort of source-code
versioning system like git.

An important part of the customization is the configuration, which has to be
exported from the `config.js` module in the customizations root folder.
Read more about [configurations here](./CONFIGURATIONS.md).

Currently, no exhaustive guide on setting up a customization exists, but see the
following examples of customizations:

- [kbh-billeder](https://github.com/CopenhagenCityArchives/kbh-billeder)
