# Configurations

An important part of the customization is the configuration, which has to be
exported from the `config.js` module in the customizations root folder.

It basically defines how Collections Online should function and any settings
which might be different between different customizations and environments.

For the future, it would probably make sense to create JSON Schema which
documents all the fields of the configuration. For now, no such thing exists.

One part of the configuration is the layout sections, which defines the layout
of a documents landing-page. Please see [layout-sections](LAYOUT-SECTIONS.md)
for more information on these layouts.
